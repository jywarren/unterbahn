		<description>I wish you good travels and hope all of your data is gathered and used in a truthful manner. Meaning, if there is a heavy impact in an area you observe by all means report and share with everyone to help with cleanup. At the same time if you find that the impact is much less than expected or nonexistent share that. This is a very different scenario compared to the incident with the Valdez. Good Luck</description>
