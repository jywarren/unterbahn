				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I recently sent this letter to the City of Somerville&#8217;s planning department, and wanted to share it. (you should send in your thoughts too, before Dec 31st 2015: <a href="mai&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#110;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x72;&#x76;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;">&#112;&#108;&#97;&#110;&#110;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#115;&#111;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x72;&#x76;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x76;</a>)</em></p>
<p>Hello, I&#8217;m writing with comments on the city&#8217;s <a href="http://www.somervillebydesign.com/planning/neighborhood-planning/union-square/">Union Square Neighborhood Plan</a>, and to share my concern with the city&#8217;s priorities stated within it. I am a co-founder of locally based environmental non-profit Public Lab, a co-founder of the Pirateship co-working space, a board member of Parts and Crafts kids&#8217; makerspace, and a member of <a href="http://unionunitedsomerville.com">Union United</a>, but today I am writing personally, as a resident of Union Square.</p>
<p>Somerville is in the midst of a major housing crisis. As the Metropolitan Area Planning Council&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Dimensions_of_Displacement_Final_Draft_2_10_14.pdf">Dimensions of Displacement</a>&#8221; report makes very clear, <strong>3,600 lower-income households in Somerville&#8217;s GLX corridor already struggle to make rent</strong>, and an additional 7-800 will likely become rent-burdened as a result of the extension. In addition, 272 of Somerville&#8217;s affordable housing units <strong>will expire before 2020</strong>, mostly in the GLX corridor.</p>
<p>This means that over the next four years, approximately <strong>4,500 households will be at risk of displacement</strong> &#8212; and that&#8217;s not even all of Somerville! Many of these are families, and because of local demographics, rent pressures disproportionately affect residents of color.</p>
<p>In the context of this crisis, SomerVision and the USNP&#8217;s goal to &#8220;make Somerville an even more exceptional place to live, work, play, and raise a family&#8221; seems not to acknowledge the challenges faced by (especially non-white) residents in the area. The plan paints a lovely picture of what Union Square could be &#8212; but we must decide if that future is one that will be shared by those residents who have worked so hard to make Union Square a special place.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been told by the city more than once that we must choose between community &#8220;benefits&#8221; from a limited amount of funds. <strong>But this is not a crisis of bike lanes or park benches; it&#8217;s a crisis of displacement</strong>. I live in an apartment which was formerly &#8212; for twenty years &#8212; the home of a local family. I&#8217;m sure many people feel the same guilt as I do in participating in displacement, but as renters we have little power to change the economics of the situation. As voters, and as participants in the planning of Union Square&#8217;s future, we do have that power. We have an opportunity to slow and even reverse this process.</p>
<p>We have this opportunity in part because, luckily, Union Square&#8217;s redevelopment will generate a lot of money. US2&#8217;s part in the development has been widely referred to as a billion dollar project. We must ensure that this wealth is not created at the expense of Somerville&#8217;s most vulnerable community members.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>the plan&#8217;s proposed ~500 new affordable housing units are simply not enough</strong>. Will we simply tell the other 4,000 households (see above) that there&#8217;s nothing we can do? I don&#8217;t believe we have to choose between a vibrant, beautiful, and tax-revenue-generating new Union Square, and one which can address the challenge of displacement. And I don&#8217;t believe we as a community wish to see so many residents and families pushed out in order to renew Union Square the wrong way. There&#8217;s enough space; there&#8217;s enough money: let&#8217;s act.</p>
<p>Many of the topics addressed in the Neighborhood Plan are important to me, and I am pleased to see the City paying attention to things like support for small local businesses, creative spaces, and other &#8220;nice-to-haves.&#8221; But these pale in comparison to the urgency of affordability for so many people in Union Square today.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration, Jeffrey Warren</p>
<p>Union Square, Somerville resident</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>I just came across this article arguing that affordable housing can profitable, and that it&#8217;s really a moral choice. A good read, and it links to an &#8220;Inclusionary Housing Calculator&#8221;:</p>

<p>The Milk Row creative zone &#8212; home of <a href="http://p.irateship.com">the pirateship</a> &#8212; was under threat recently from a rezoning plan at the Somerville City Hall. The re-zoning was withdrawn, but we&#8217;ve been trying to organize a bit better to be able to meet such threats in the future; the proposal might be revised and re-submitted, for example.</p>
<p>I just did a doodle of the zone, which extends from Church St. to Dane St, Somerville Ave to the railroad tracks, including Market Basket and a bunch of other buildings. Maybe we should make some posters!</p>
