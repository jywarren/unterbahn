		<description><![CDATA[I think everything said made a lot of sense.
However, what about this? what if you added a little content?
I am not suggesting your content isn&#039;t good, however suppose you added a title to maybe grab a person&#039;s attention? I 
mean Unterbahn  Blog Archive  Vectorizing sketches 
and photos with your smartphone/web browser is a little vanilla.
You should glance at Yahoo&#039;s front page and watch how they 
create post headlines to get viewers interested.
You might try adding a video or a pic or two to 
get readers interested about what you&#039;ve got to say.
In my opinion, it would bring your website a little livelier.
