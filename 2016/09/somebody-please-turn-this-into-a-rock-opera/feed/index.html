		<description><![CDATA[We do have something like this in Sweden where redevelopment is a norm, but you still get lots of displacement of the resourceless/weak, and it really does affect the neighbourhood. I call Redevelopment something that is done to 60 year old houses, that has an effect on the standard of the  house not just the wallpaper and floors, might be insulation, new pipes, denser neighbourhoods etc..

In Stockholm redevelopment means an increase of 20%-70% in rental costs, and with newly built houses you can pay upto 300% more than an older house that has not been redeveloped. This almost always means displacement of people the local drunks etc.

The CBA is a very good thing in Sweden, the developer at least have to make a show of investing in the local community. This does not always work out because many areas do not have those  community organisations you are talking about,  this can lead to a very top-down type of investment. I&#039;m guessing that isn&#039;t that much of a problem where you choose to live.

We might be talking about different things, the devil is in the details and different countries differ a lot in legal responsibilities.
