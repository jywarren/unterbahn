The Milk Row creative zone -- home of [the pirateship](http://p.irateship.com) -- was under threat recently from a rezoning plan at the Somerville City Hall. The re-zoning was withdrawn, but we've been trying to organize a bit better to be able to meet such threats in the future; the proposal might be revised and re-submitted, for example.

I just did a doodle of the zone, which extends from Church St. to Dane St, Somerville Ave to the railroad tracks, including Market Basket and a bunch of other buildings. Maybe we should make some posters!
