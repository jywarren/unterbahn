![](pennant-400x300.jpg "pennant") I like being a whole scene from a movie, so this year I chose a real classic -- the scene where the Delorean flies over the billboard and gets stuck in the pennants in Back the Future II. Note inaccurately placed flux capacitor (also not 1.21 gigawatts) -- forgive my not wanting to install actual tinted glass or working gullwing doors so I could show off that piece of hardware. I ran out of time while making mini pennants. Original scene at bottom. ![](rear-400x300.jpg "rear") ![](on-head-400x300.jpg "on-head") ![](lyon-estates-500x266.jpg "lyon-estates")
