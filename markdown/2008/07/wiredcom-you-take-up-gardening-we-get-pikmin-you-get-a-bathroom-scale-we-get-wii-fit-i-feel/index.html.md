[Wired.com]: You take up gardening, we get Pikmin. You get a bathroom scale, we get Wii Fit. I feel like it would be a disservice to our readers if I didn't ask: What are your hobbies right now?

[Shigeru Miyamoto]: I knew someone was going to ask me that question. (Nintendo President Satoru) Iwata has told me absolutely not to tell anyone. Of course, I did go jogging in Central Park this morning.

[Wired.com]: All right, there's our clue.

[Shigeru Miyamoto]: Yesterday I ate a hamburger.
