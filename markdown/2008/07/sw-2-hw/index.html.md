Hardware, fabbed like hydroponic marijuana, will be cheap and sold next to beef jerky in gas stations. Software, customizable and requiring wealth to run on a universal Turing machine, will be for the upper class. This is already the case with $10 Famicom clones in India and China, vs. emulated Nintendo ROMs on a 2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo.
