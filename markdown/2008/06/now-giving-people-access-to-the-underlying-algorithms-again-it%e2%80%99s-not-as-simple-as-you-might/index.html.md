"Now, giving people access to the underlying algorithms, again, it's not as simple as you might think, in that we're dealing with these generative systems, and that we spent a lot of time discovering these rules that gave us reasonable-looking traffic or crime or whatever. So, it would more be the process of giving them access to the underlying generative structures, and letting them discover other rules. So that's something that would be a very different thing than a game."
