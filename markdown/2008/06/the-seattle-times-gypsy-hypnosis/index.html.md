[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002166501_hypnotic01.html](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002166501_hypnotic01.html) Gypsy hypnosis has been described as bigoted nonsense but the idea that a sequence of words could trigger logical shutdown and allow "superuser" access to someones brain is fascinating even without blaming it on gipsies.
