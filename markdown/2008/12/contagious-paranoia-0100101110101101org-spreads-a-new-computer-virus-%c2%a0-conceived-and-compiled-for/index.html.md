"Contagious Paranoia - 0100101110101101.ORG spreads a new computer virus   Conceived and compiled for the invitation to the 49th Venice Biennale, Biennale.py is both a computer virus and a work of art. The virus is made public and spread from the Slovenian Pavilion on the opening day of the exhibition, June the 6th 2001. Biennale.py becomes headline-hitting news, suddenly turning into an unprecedented performance, a controversial work of art revealing how media hysteria can be theoretically provoked and raised. Following the spreading of the virus, Symantec Corporation, world leader in Internet security technology, detects Biennale.py and starts the hunt. Eva, 0100101110101101.ORG's spokeswoman, says: «As part of an organization that produces art, my only responsibility is to be irresponsible»."
