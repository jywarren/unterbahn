By Bernard Carlson - really good, written in 2001 but a lot (!) of parallels with municipal Wifi efforts and also with [Meraki](http://www.meraki.com) and mesh networking... the idea of consumers setting up independent local shared wifi. The openness of the Internet is in many ways a sham... Comcast and other providers of "last mile" infrastructure are the (1800s) Western Union of the Internet. They and now 3G cell phone internet providers now control access to the net... ironically the latter is now mainly AT&T... Bell.
