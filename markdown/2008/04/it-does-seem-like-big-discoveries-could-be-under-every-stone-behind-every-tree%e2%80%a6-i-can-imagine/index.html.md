It does seem like big discoveries could be under every stone, behind every tree... I can imagine demonstrating revolutionary concepts to people in 1600 AD or to Aristotle, using simple items like string, weights, rubber balls (did they have rubber?). For example, many thought that firing an arrow upwards would result in the arrow landing far to the east if the earth turned... that could be disproved simply by bouncing a ball in place on a moving platform, like a ship. Does that mean that there are other breakthrough discoveries all around us, easy to demonstrate with household objects, if only we understood what their behaviors meant?
