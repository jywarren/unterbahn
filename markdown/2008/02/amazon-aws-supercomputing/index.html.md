Is anyone selling distributed parallel processing to universities and laboratories based on Amazon's [cloud computing initiative](http://aws.amazon.com/)? Even if the base price per teraflop isn't great, you can scale linearly and you don't need any physical space at all... it seems like there would be a lot of benefits. 

 There is some discussion on the idea [here](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/06/amazon_ec2_for_.html), but I haven't seen any serious implementations.
