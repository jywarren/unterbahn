Idea for a [Kogbox](http://www.kogbox.com) snippet: "Colors I've Used" - a timeline of colors used in design work. You could extend it to fonts too. Basically input all the URLs of work you've done, upload all the images, and it extracts major colors. You can assign them dates. 

 Then do color analytics... how have your color choices changed over time? Spectral graphs... by RGB, saturation, color spread (what diversity of colors you've used), percent change based on hexidecimal values...
