We currently have three short codes and one long code for those who twitter internationally.

In the US, use 40404. 
In Canada, use 21212. 
In India, use 5566511.
Anywhere else, use +44 7624 801423

For all people using the international number: once your phone is verified, you'll be able to send your updates to +44 7624 801423 , but you will not be able to receive text updates from Twitter.  Find out more on the Twitter Blog.
