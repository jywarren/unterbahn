...Might the cake serve as a platform for the staging of ideas, great and small? What would a Brechtian cuisine look like? The toy theater revival, now in its tenth year, gains momentum; but it has yet to cross the thresh-old of the edible. Or has it?

"Erst kommt das Fressen," wrote Brecht, in his most famous proverb. "Dann kommt die Moral." First comes the eating, then the moral. Critic Fredric Jameson has addressed the compressed literary form of Brecht's maxims, a style that recalls the direct, minimal language of the Bible and which the playwright used as a means of political address through epic dramaturgy. Minimal narrative, only gestus.
