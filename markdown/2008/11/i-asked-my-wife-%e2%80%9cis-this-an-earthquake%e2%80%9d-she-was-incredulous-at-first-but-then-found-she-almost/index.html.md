"

I asked my wife, "Is this an earthquake?" She was incredulous at first, but then found she almost lost her footing and held a wall for support. "It is an earthquake," she said. I looked out the window toward the new office towers going up south of my building, and could have sworn I saw them swaying. We talked for a couple of seconds about what we should do-whether we should get under a doorway, or get downstairs. Then it all stopped, about 35 seconds afterward.

I had Twhirl, my Twitter client of choice, on my desktop, and immediately typed, "Did anyone else in Beijing just feel that earthquake?" The client refreshed "tweets" from others, and there were at least half a dozen comments before mine about the quake. Amazingly, I saw that there were people from Shanghai who'd felt it too.
