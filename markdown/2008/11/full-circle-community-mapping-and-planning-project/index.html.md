Phase 1:  Neighborhood Inventory: what is out there right now?

A detailed inventory of land use, housing, transportation, jobs, culture, recreation, natural resources and historic points is compiled by each neighborhood partner through the use of handheld computers connected to the internet. This information can be updated as needed.  Maps, reports, and statistics are generated based on the information collected.
