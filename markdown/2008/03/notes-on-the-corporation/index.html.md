Says that it's "grotesque" that the 14th amendment was used to give "personhood" to corporations. Idiotic.

Transfer of liability... transfer of agency...

They're people, but not as regards intellectual property law...? Immortal...

"No soul to save, no body to incarcerate."

Legally bound to put bottom line first?

Milton Friedman can go to hell.

Corporation is an "externalizing machine"???
    - They're saying they externalize anything but profit?

This is really dumb so far.
