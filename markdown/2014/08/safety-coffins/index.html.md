Loving the band name [Fan Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death_(band)) and brainstorming with [Mathew Lippincott](http://publiclab.org/profile/mathew) and [Stevie Lewis](http://publiclab.org/profile/stevie) of Public Lab, I now want to start a band called The Safety Coffins. Mathew suggested the above image as an album cover, via [Retronaut](http://www.retronaut.com/2013/12/patent-for-device-for-indicating-life-in-buried-persons/).

I first read about safety coffins in Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery, but Wikipedia has a nice article with more pictures: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_coffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_coffin). TL;DR if you're buried alive, there's a bell you can ring to be let out. And food and stuff.

We also thought OSHA should publish guidelines for workplace safety for the dead. But do ghosts need handrails and HEPA filters?
