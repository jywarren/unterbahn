The format: a concise composition of 3 or fewer elements. The best part about this one is the tiny fish head which pivots the meaning of the land haiku in a humorous manner.

Thanks to Matt Boch for documenting this one. Please post your own! I haven't been able to successfully author one myself yet... do they have to be naturally occurring? Unsure.
