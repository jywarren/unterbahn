Specifically, he recommends adding 5 words to the 2nd Amendment, so that it would read as follows: 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms when serving in the Militia shall not be infringed.'may find religious beliefs outdated or even immoral today. But I think the above statement tends to focus on the side of religion that has very specific details like "turned into a pillar of salt" or "there was a burning bush" -- and basically has no respect for religion as a set of cultural values and narratives. 

Other side of the coin - so starting from scratch, science would be exactly the same? We're all just slowly uncovering this one structure of information and technology which is inevitable? I just hate that. Like, internal combustion engines have been developed for over a hundred years. We've really optimized them, and now that we want to do electric motors, we're having to catch up just to make a vehicle that is about as performant. Does that mean that electric is "more advanced" or that it "comes after" gasoline-burning tech? 

OK, that wasn't such a good example but I guess I mean to say that I see sci/tech development and "discovery" as a kind of semi-random path in a much larger field of possibilities; a path which is shaped by political, cultural, and sometimes accidental forces. I tend to think that if we "started over" with science and religion, we might have inherited a pretty similar set of basic religious beliefs... I mean maybe it'd be a spaghetti monster instead of some dude and his son or a guy with a bunch of arms or an elephant's head, or whatever. But we'd probably still have strong familial bonds, a tendency not to kill people on an individual level but a tendency to have wars, jealousy, greed, I mean a lot of the basics would be about the same. But maybe we'd all drive dirigibles around, or live in trees, or have sail-powered trains, or play complex organ music instead of use Google Spreadsheets. Maybe our socks would be attached to our pants, or laptops would have clear-backed screens so you don't need a backlight. Maybe we'd live in underground burrows, or there wouldn't be intellectual property law, we'd have polymer-based muscles flapping flippers on our jetskis powered by algae instead of electric motors in our Chevy Volts.

Time to get on an airplane...
