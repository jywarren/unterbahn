It's a little premature, but ongoing experiments in cutting my own records into the underside of a CD are showing a lot of promise, so I'm hereby founding a new record label. I'm already in negotiations to sign two different record deals -- more on this soon, but the plan so far is for each record to be cut, live, and for there to be only one copy of each.

Anyhow, I haven't decided what the record label will be called, but here are my tests so far:

OK, not so great fidelity yet, but definite progress over earlier tests. The stylus looks like this, although I'm working on a few different prototypes:
