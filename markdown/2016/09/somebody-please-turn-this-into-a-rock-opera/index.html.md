As I recently posted, Alex Ezorsky made this great educational animated video about how a Community Benefits Agreement could help prevent housing displacement in Union Square, Somerville.

As I mentioned, it reminds me of the Home Movies' episode where they make a Franz Kafka Rock Opera:

So -- Alex sent me the lyrics. And he's made the video and lyrics copyleft -- Creative Commons Attribution!

This is TOTALLY a rock opera in disguise. If you can shred, PLEASE rescore this video and post it! Email me at jeff@unterbhan.com, too!

Here goes -- just read these lines while listening to the rock opera above:

> You love your neighborhood
> 
> But things are changing. Some changes are good for everyone
> 
> but others aren't
> 
> The rent's are rising so quickly many people can no longer afford to
>   live or work in the town they love.
> 
> You're neighborhood is facing re-development and as a result the
>   current population risks displacement. 
> 
> So who is responsible? And how can you ensure that development
>   benefits the residents instead of replacing them?
> 
> Lets start with the basics. Re-development is when a private
>   development company buys property and turns it into something they can
>   make a profit from.
> 
> Re-development operations can vary in size, from a single lot, to an
>   entire "neighborhood development plan"
> 
> Ah good thought, why not voice your concerns to the city?
> 
> They might even offer you meetings with the developer or a city
>   appointed planning authority who will "listen to your concerns".
> 
> The city will look out for you right???
> 
> Developers need city approval to build their projects, and here's
>   where you'd want them to leverage a deal to benefit the residents. 
> 
> But developers have lots to offer a city,  with campaign donations,
>   project funding and the fact that new development can bring increased
>   tax revenue, new jobs, and amenities to attract new residents. 
> 
> It's not hard to see how a City might do everything it can to please
>    the developers...often at the expense of the residents.
> 
> Sometimes a small group is able to voice their needs. 
> 
> But what about everyone else? 
> 
> And how can you tell whether your concerns will be taken into account,
>   or dumped in the trash?
> 
> When you get a new apartment; do you just trust that the landlord will
>   respect your needs as a tenant?
> 
> No! You need a lease, or a legal agreement, to guarantee your needs
>   are met and both sides do what they say they will do.
> 
> A contract between the concerned residents and the developer is called
>   a COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT. 
> 
> A CBA gives decision-making power to the community.
> 
> A CBA is the only contract that can guarantee that the needs of the
>   residents, represented in community groups, are included in plans for
>   development.  Because in a CBA the community groups are signing and
>   enforcing the agreement.
> 
> Developers might not want to sign the CBA because it can restrict
>   their profits or because they are already working out a deal with the
>   City.
> 
> But development should benefit YOU, the people who live and work here
>   now, and YOU deserve to have power and influence over development.
> 
> Your power grows with increased participation.
> 
> With larger more organized and more diligent coalitions, with more
>   active members, and through protests, petitions, and participation in
>   public elections the residents CAN demand the proper attention and
>   leverage needed to get a CBA..
> 
> An unhappy public can be a huge threat to both the City and
>   Developers.
> 
> In contrast addressing the needs of the residents with a CBA will
>   ensure Developers benefit from a happy community in support of the
>   development to their city. 
> 
> Here in Somerville, US2 is the developer contracted by the city for a
>   neighborhood-wide re-development in Union Square.
> 
> We are, Union United, a rapidly growing coalition of Somerville
>   residents, businesses, churches, unions, and community organizaions,
>   joined in the effort to create development without displacement
>   through specific goals outlined in a legally binding CBA with US2 and
>   the City.
> 
> Time is running out and we need YOU to join us, participate in our
>   meetings, spread the word, and make sure Union Square in Somerville is
>   added to the growing list of communities across the Nation who've
>   developed with  a Community Benefits Agreement..
