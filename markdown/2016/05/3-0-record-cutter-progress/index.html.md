I tested cutting with this today but it came out very wobbly -- not sure why pitch would be unstable but I wonder if it's related to how I hold it? More tests necessary.

Back to the Sylvania, which is available for $28 in pink... $32 in other colors. Easy decision; people must have terrible taste not to want pink.

Good news on record time, though; 1:16 worth of Starfucker fit on the DVD at top. Partially due to the K'nex piece I'm now using as a turntable clamp, which opens up the last few seconds of space on the disc.
