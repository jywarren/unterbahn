I still need to build an arm or mount for this, but it's the first record cutter I've made that doesn't require any tools except scissors to make. Instead of disassembling a speaker to get the voice coil, I drove a pin directly through the cone of a speaker. To stiffen the "ball-end," I drove it through a piece of stiff card paper, which you can see taped to the speaker side.

The vibration is plenty strong to cut grooves, so I'm optimistic that we're one step closer to an easy-to-build kit.
