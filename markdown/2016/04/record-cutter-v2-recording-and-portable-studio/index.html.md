This is my current setup to cut records -- trying to keep it as portable as possible, as I'm typically recording people in person now. My goal is to do a lot of recording as I improve the design, so that I learn more about what works and doesn't through real use. Also, I learn what's truly portable and durable enough to travel with!

The new v2 cutter is really nice and small ([see yesterday's post](http://unterbahn.com/2016/04/record-cutter-version-2-miniaturization/)). And it's quite high fidelity -- see this recording I did yesterday off an MP3:
