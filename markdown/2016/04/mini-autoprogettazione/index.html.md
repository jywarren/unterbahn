I made a mini version of [Enzo Mari's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Mari) 1974 "Autoprogettazione"; a kind of early DIY/open source furniture design made so that all cuts can be done with a hand saw, and all joints with just nails. This chair is just one of a set including tables and such, too.

Nice minimal look, which I reproduced with coffee stirring sticks from the Marcel Breuer former Whitney Museum, now the Met extension. From the top floor Blue Bottle cafe. In the spirit of open source.

And here's a PDF with all of the designs:
