Via a friend who's mother made this extremely delicious dish I'd like to reproduce:

> Take white bread, preferably old and soak it in milk then mix in an egg or two, and spices (parsley, garlic, salt pepper and whatever takes your fancy) and that is your stuffing. Rub the chicken with the same spices, stuff it with the bread and milk mixture and shove it to the oven for an unspecified length of time in an unspecified temperature. Good luck, and please report on the outcome!
