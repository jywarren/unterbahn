Am I misunderstanding what's going on here? Is Lego selling [killer drone play kits](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Armed-Forces-Character-Building-Tri-Service/dp/B008N9OW6I/ref=sr_1_9?s=kids&ie=UTF8&qid=1343755489&sr=1-9)? And [attack jet kits](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Character-Building-Armed-Forces-Tornado/dp/B0055RDCW6/ref=pd_sim_sbs_k_h_b_cs_4/280-4172989-8526048)? And does "Character Building" refer to constructing a character from Lego to play with, or is it making the case that playing with military-themed Lego will "build character"? I'm going to assume the less ironic option, I guess.
