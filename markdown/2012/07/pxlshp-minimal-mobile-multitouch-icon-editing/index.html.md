I went on a week vacation recently, and while out of range of the internet on a remote island in Maine, I wrote a simple mobile-phone icon editor.

It's minimal: 16x16, black and white, works with touch events but it's just a website:

I'd like to improve it but want to see some battle-testing first. Would you all give it a go? Post icons you've made here!

It's free software: [http://github.com/jywarren/pxlshp](http://github.com/jywarren/pxlshp)

Now you know how i spend vacations. I went swimming too.
