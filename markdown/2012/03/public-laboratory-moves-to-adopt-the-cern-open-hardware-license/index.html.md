As the above user dashboard shows, PLOTS is in the midst of a license changeover for our open hardware designs, to the new(ish) [CERN Open Hardware License 1.1](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki). [Read the announcement here](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/3-9-2012/plots-adoption-cern-open-hardware-license) and see [the agreement form and a list of signatories here](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/open-hardware-licensing).
