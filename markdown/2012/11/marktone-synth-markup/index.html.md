I saw a dj in london who was synthing from some kind of domain specific language for synth generation, it was rad. Will find his info soon. But in the meantime I wrote a simpler version of it in Firefox:

([https://github.com/jywarren/marktone](https://github.com/jywarren/marktone))

I'd love to get more complex sounds in here, or maybe some kind of syntax for walking or generating patterns.
