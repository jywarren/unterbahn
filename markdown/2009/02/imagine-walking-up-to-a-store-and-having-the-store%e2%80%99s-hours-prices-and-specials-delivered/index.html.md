"Imagine walking up to a store and having the store's hours, prices, and specials delivered right to your mobile phone or GPS receiver. Or arriving at the airport and having your flight gate and status appear automatically. That is the primary goal of viaPlace: to provide users with dynamic content based on their physical location."
