This mirror reflects a wide-angled view without distortion - straight lines in the real world translate to straight lines on the convex surface. It was made for a stair-climbing robot at the University of Pennsylvania. A camera pointed at the mirror can see a very wide-angled view in which the stairs appear straight, making navigation easier.
