I've been at the MobileActive/Unicef workshop in Amman, Jordan since yesterday, and got to present some of my work on low cost [mapping with kites](http://unterbahn.com/2009/11/grassroots-aerial-map/) and balloons. One thing people have been asking about is if people in informail communities would object to being photographed from above. While I completely understand this question, it does strike me as odd - they're photographed from space all the time by Navteq and TeleAtlas, without being asked permission. 

First, though, I wanted to make it clear that I'm not interested in developing tools for people like myself to unilaterally image a community - the whole idea is to make tools *for* a community to map themselves -- as a form of expression, as a tool for community planning, and as an exploratory process. My hope is that the community I'm hoping to work with in Lima will want to publish and distribute their maps, but that is of course their decision to make. 

At the same time, it's also clear that there is a practical and psychological difference between flying a kite/balloon with a camera on it while you are actually in a community, and flying a satellite which they cannot see, having never visited the community you're imaging. But I'm hoping that the former can form the basis of a more participatory way of mapping contested geographies. In any case, this is a great ongoing discussion, and I'm eager to see how it plays out on the ground in Lima.
