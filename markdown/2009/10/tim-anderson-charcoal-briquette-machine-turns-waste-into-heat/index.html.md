[Tim Anderson](http://www.instructables.com/member/TimAnderson/) says:

> The Chinese make very effective cooking fuel briquettes from waste cellulose and carbon materials, using local clay for a binder.> 
> The briquettes are cylindrical with a number of air passages through them.> 
> An expat living here told me he had a water heater in Germany in the 1960's that used the same type of briquettes.
