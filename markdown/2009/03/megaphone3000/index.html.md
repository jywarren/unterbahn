> <span>"Megaphone3000" is a collection of 10 mini games that are played on a large public screen with an average cell phone. Your phone becomes your controller. No special software is necessary. All games are controlled with either the player's voice or the number pad. Players battle to stay connected - the loser gets disconnected and the winner battles on! </span>
