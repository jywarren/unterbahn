    Other work:

    I'm a partner at [Vestal Design](http://vestaldesign.com), where I've done lots of stuff like [Xobni](http://www.xobni.com)'s user interface and branding and information design for [ClimateCounts](http://www.climatecounts.org/). I also taught information design workshops for General Electric and Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai.

    I work occasionally and excitedly with Natalie Jeremijenko as part of her [xDesign Lab](http://www.environmentalhealthclinic.com) at NYU.

    [Weardrobe](http://www.weardrobe.com) is a site for tagging and organizing clothing online, which I created with Suzanne Xie and Richard Tong.

    [Cut&Paste Labs](http://cutpastelabs.com) was founded by Diego Rotalde and me; we taught workshops on web design and development in Lima, Peru. Some went on to found their own firms:

    I've also designed a few zany things which people have enjoyed, like the [DoubleSpace Kitchenette](http://www.vestaldesign.com/design/doublespace-kitchenette/):
