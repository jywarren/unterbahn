Books that have made the shortlist but inexplicably failed to win include "A Pictorial Book of Tongue Coatings," "Sex After Death," "Waterproofing Your Child" and "Cheese Problems Solved" - which, its publisher says, provides "responses to more than 200 of the most commonly asked questions about cheese," with special emphasis on mozzarella, blue cheese and cheddar.
