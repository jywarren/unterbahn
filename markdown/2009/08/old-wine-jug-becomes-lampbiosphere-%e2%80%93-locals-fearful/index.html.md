I decided to rescue an empty bottle of Carlo Rossi and convert it into a self-contained 'biosphere', as well as a lamp. I Dremeled through the base of the jar to thread the wire through, and epoxied the whole thing shut. Now stuff is starting to grow! 

At the lab, most people have expressed fear and trepidation at what will come of this experiment. The consensus seems to be that it will all die, and moldy putrified goop will become sentient and kill us all. I, on the other hand, continue to be optimistic.
