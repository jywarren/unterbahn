Playing with [Map Warper](http://warper.geothings.net/maps/preview/1615) (see [recent post](http://unterbahn.com/2009/10/map-warper-rectifying-maps/)) and trying to rectify drawn maps for inclusion in Cartagen. Doesn't work that well... the warper assumes smooth distortions, not ones based on people's semantic and decidedly qualitative understanding of space. An alternative stretching algorithm might be interesting... regardless Map Warper should work well with balloon photography. More soon.
