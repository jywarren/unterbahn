Here's a Gosper curve cut into paper with a [Silhouette Cameo](//publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-30-2015/silhouette-cameo-desktop-paper-cutter-for-prototyping) desktop paper cutter. Thanks to [Owen Maresh](http://owen.maresh.info) for showing me the Gosper curve, which is a space-filling curve formed with a single line, and therefore, here, with a single cut.
