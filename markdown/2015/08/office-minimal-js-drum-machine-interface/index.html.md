I've been doing a lot of small projects for fun, and partially to improve my JavaScript coding practices. I wrote this JS-based drum machine, or almost finished it, although it needs some work on the timers and more samples (only the top row of instruments works at the moment). If you know of some sick free samples, I'd love to use them.

Use it directly (designed for smartphone use): [http://jywarren.github.io/office/]()

On Github [here](https://github.com/jywarren/office). Try it here in an iframe:

It's sort of loosely based on the Pocket Operator, which I got a couple months ago:
