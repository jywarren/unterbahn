Parts and Crafts is a wonderful local Somerville institution, and one which has hosted many Public Lab events! They're doing a drive to raise money for free scholarships for kids who couldn't otherwise afford to attend their programs.

DIY culture, and P&C in particular, is **such a wonderful thing** -- PLEASE help to ensure that it reaches those in need. Everyone deserves the opportunity!

I am trying to make them some stickers, too -- and since one activity they do SUPER WELL is a "One Lightsaber Per Child" workshop, I wanted to illustrate that:
