First, partial day of Antfarm class at [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org) today. Much excitement and some bugs found (lol). A queen was quickly suggested and implemented, who spawns new ants, too quickly, then too slowly. New ants won't change color, unfortunately -- [https://github.com/jywarren/antfarm/issues/6](https://github.com/jywarren/antfarm/issues/6)

Then, overpopulation quickly became a problem, so we opened issue 5, "ant death" [https://github.com/jywarren/antfarm/issues/5](https://github.com/jywarren/antfarm/issues/5)

Good progress for a first day -- the entomologists have agreed to come back next week with more ideas and I'll get a permanent ant farm installed on the windowsill in the meantime.
