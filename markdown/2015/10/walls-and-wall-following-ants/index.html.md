Antfarm class today again; I introduced walls -- red pixels can't be crossed. But the ants struggled to navigate around walls. We used a basic bump-along-the-wall strategy but some of them get stuck. Still, a great class -- lots of complex behaviors and ideas, and some successful prototypes. See below. (code here posted [on the wiki](https://github.com/jywarren/antfarm/wiki/Home))

In other news, I left the colony foraging antfarm code running for a week, and it was still running when we started class today. There's a population limit of 100, though, so this wasn't "ecological balance" but it's still interesting to see.
