I've always been a sucker for hand-lettered scalloped or smoked glass doors; MIT's Infinite Corridor has some nice ones, for example. The best are detective or lawyer nameplate doors, from the 20s, say.

So, in a long-planned but long-near-abandoned plan, I installed a smoked glass "coating" on the inside of our apartment's front door, and lettered our names in white acrylic on the outside, which gives a nice drop-shadow effect due to the thickness of the glass. If anyone's interested in this kind of door lettering, ping me. I'd love to do more!
