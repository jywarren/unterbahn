Had a great day skiing at the [Red Hill Outing Club](http://www.nelsap.org/nh/redhill.html), where I am now a member:

BB Gun Biathalon -- followed by an 80's dance party!

The run-it-yourself rope tow lift.

[This website](http://www.nelsap.org/nh/redhill.html) has a great photo of the lodge from 1964:

Neat bit of trivia - there's [a New Hampshire Superior Court decision](http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/1998/redhill.htm) about a dispute over the club's land.

I'd like to think that the decision, which upheld the club's right to the land, hinged on the ability to ski without a lift -- i.e. skinning up! But maybe that's reading too much into it.
