I have been building a collection of exemplars of the genre of foodstuffs which feature _Sciurus carolinensis_ (in celebration of this ineffable crepuscular member of suborder _Sciuromorpha_) -- a worthy endeavor.

> Note, to my confusion, as someone somewhat familiar with the en-coding of web-sites, that the Korean dish listed above actually **does** list "squirrrel", but strangely not in the place where I had originally expected it. It is possible, though implausible, that the recipe upon which my modification was based already included this ingredient. As a person of partial Korean ancestry myself and an enthusiast of Korean cuisine, I find this distinctly unlikely, but must weigh its possibility in light of the consistency of the aforementioned bug in all other instances.
