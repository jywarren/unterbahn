> So our 1 volt signal is placed at the non-inverting input (the plus) and the op amp says "15 volts, coming right up!". Ah, but the op amp doesn't quite have it. The op amp outputs 13.4 volts are so and then stops. "But WAIT!" you say, "why can't this op amp output as much as I wanted? The ideal ones can output INFINITY. Can't I just get one of those?" The short answer: no, you can't.
