My friend Pete Feigenbaum's recent album "%" got a poor review on Pitchfork, which is probably what Pete was hoping for. His band [Dinowalrus](http://www.dinowalrus.com/) will be playing at Great Scott in Allston (Boston) on April 1st, around 9:30.

I have to love the [Pitchfork review](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13977-percent/), which includes such gems as:

> About the only thing that holds it together is an almost joke-y baritone from Feigenbaum that barks lyrics like, "A Chinese wall/ A toilet stall."

which I'm sure just makes Pete extremely proud.
