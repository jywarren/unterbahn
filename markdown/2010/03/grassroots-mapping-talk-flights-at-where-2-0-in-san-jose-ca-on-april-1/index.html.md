For grassroots mapping enthusiasts in the Bay Area, I&#8217;ll be speaking at [Where 2.0](http://en.oreilly.com/where2010/public/schedule/detail/14305) in San Jose on April 1, presenting the [Grassroots Mapping Lima](http://grassrootsmapping.org/tag/lima/) project and talking about our plans for future work. Afterwards, we&#8217;ll try to do a demonstration flight at the Where Faire. 

Where 2.0 charges admission, but WhereCamp is a free and open &#8216;unconference&#8217; and I&#8217;m hoping to do a workshop there where people can build their own rigs, do test flights, and generally do a bit more hands-on work. More on WhereCamp soon &#8212; we&#8217;re still finding out if we can fly at Google&#8217;s Mountain View campus&#8230; they&#8217;re the hosts.
