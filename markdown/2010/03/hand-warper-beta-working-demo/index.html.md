<p>[Cartagen warping tool demo](http://vimeo.com/10213658) from [Jeffrey Warren](http://vimeo.com/user263756) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

As promised in [an earlier post](http://grassrootsmapping.org/2010/03/hand-warping-tool-coming-soon/), the hand-warping tool is online, although &#8216;beta&#8217; may be a generous descriptor&#8230; lots of features are still coming, please be patient! Watch the above video for an introduction.

This is basically a tool for people to upload and easily stitch together their balloon- and kite-photos. I wanted to add that it&#8217;s optimized for ease-of-use, and even for folks with limited tech literacy &#8212; we&#8217;re working on other techniques for mass warping and stitching.

Suggestions or what-have-you can be posted to the [Cartagen Knitter page](http://wiki.grassrootsmapping.org/show/CartagenKnitter) (yes, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m calling it) or posted here in comments. 

Coming soon: a pen tool to trace out buildings from the images you upload.
