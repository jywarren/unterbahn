Here&#8217;s Juan Pablo II (as far as I can tell) on Google Maps. ([Link here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=&#038;sll=-12.230851,-76.959915&#038;sspn=0.015309,0.043945&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=-12.231391,-76.950088&#038;spn=0.001914,0.005493&#038;t=h&#038;z=18))

It doesn&#8217;t look so bad in fact&#8230; we&#8217;d expected older imagery. But the detail is not quite good enough to make out which homes are which, and there are no labels or anything, so it&#8217;s quite hard to figure out where you are. We&#8217;ll see how these sync up with the higher resolution balloon imagery we capture&#8230; hopefully tomorrow!
