[Jean-Babtiste Labrune](http://web.media.mit.edu/~labrune/) and [Oliver Yeh](http://space.1337arts.com/) joined us for the final day of the [NuVu Studio workshop](http://nuvustudio.org/balloon/the-finale-of-the-balloon-studio/) on grassroots mapping, where all the students presented their work and we had some good discussion &#8211; both about mapping techniques and on a conceptual level. JB spoke a bit about DIY culture and Oliver showed some of his high-altitude ballooning work.

This was a great chance for students to push some of our [Advanced Projects](http://wiki.grassrootsmapping.org/show/AdvancedProjects) forward, and has built on previous work such as the [Kite Balloon prototype](http://grassrootsmapping.org/2010/04/kite-balloon-prototyping/) we built during WhereCamp 2010.
