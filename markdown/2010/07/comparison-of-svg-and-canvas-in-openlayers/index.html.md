Tobias Sauerwein recently emailed me about my mapping framework [Cartagen](http://cartagen.org), and linked to his fantastic analysis of SVG/Canvas suitability for map rendering. Thanks!

[OpenLayers with Canvas](http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/Future/OpenLayersWithCanvas#Testoftheoptimizations)

_Oh, of course, it bears mentioning [this earlier comparison](http://unterbahn.com/2009/08/svg-vs/) I dug up some months ago, which focuses on SVG/Canvas different sized rendering areas and different #s of objects._
