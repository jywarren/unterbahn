OK, possible dumb question: can we use a prism or a [stripped CD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YStZk2zANvk&feature=player_embedded) to split some light reflected off an object or material, and photograph its spectrum with an off-the-shelf digital camera? Above, spectral response of a typical CCD as we might find in a digicam. Below, the range of infrared used in [IR spectroscopy](http://orgchem.colorado.edu/hndbksupport/irtutor/tutorial.html)

It shows the frequencies of IR radiation absorbed and the % of the incident light that passes through the molecule without being absorbed. The spectrum has two regions. The fingerprint region is unique for a molecule and the functional group region is similar for molecules with the same functional groups.

Well, [these folks at The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, India](http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~scipop/Obsetion/spectro/pizza_box_sp.htm) did it with a pizza box:

But what about the infrared range? I'm concerned about this statement, from the first link above:

> ...the colour filter stripes tend to reduce the imager sensitivity to IR wavelengths. However some colour cameras still have a significant sensitivity to IR, especially if they'Â’ve been designed to be sensitive down to very low light levels.
