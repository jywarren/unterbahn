This spectrometer, the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), captures imagery from 224 spectral bands, which can be visualized as a stack of images 224 pixels deep. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory flies it around on a plane.

> The sides of the cube are slices showing the edges of the top in all 224 of the AVIRIS spectral channels. The tops of the sides are in the visible part of the spectrum (wavelength of 400 nanometers), and the bottoms are in the infrared (2,500 nanometers). The sides are pseudo-color, ranging from black and blue (low response) to red (high response).> 
> 
> Of particular interest is the small region of high response in the upper right corner of the larger side. This response is in the red part of the visible spectrum (about 700 nanometers), and is due to the presence of 1-centimeter-long (half-inch) red brine shrimp in the evaporation pond.
