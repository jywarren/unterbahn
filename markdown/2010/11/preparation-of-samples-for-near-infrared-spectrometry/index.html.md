The University of Colorado Boulder has [a nice guide](http://orgchem.colorado.edu/procedures/IR/IRprep.html) on preparing solid samples on salt plates (expensive, but how much?), though they focus on the thin film technique where you slice your sample super thin.

More reasonable for a DIY version might be preparing a **mull**, which means grinding your sample in mineral oil until it has the consistency of honey. The standard oil is Nujol, a heavy inert paraffin oil, which just so happens to have been advertised as a laxative in the 1920s:

Here's some quick reading about specimen preparation: [Introduction to spectroscopy](http://books.google.com/books?id=FkaNOdwk0FQC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=preparing+mull+spectrometry&source=bl&ots=ysxfGMQ4Fg&sig=B6OvfReYIL1UBLnMv35cnfrPZ8U&hl=en&ei=CRXcTKWwK4H58AakgPWaCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false), by Donald L. Pavia, Gary M. Lampman, George S. Kriz, (Google Books)

However, CCDs (as in the [last post](http://unterbahn.com/2010/11/typical-ccd-spectral-response-vs-ir-spectrography/)) are pretty useless at over 1 micron wavelengths, and the relevant wavelengths we need are between 2.5 and 20 microns. What about CMOD sensors? What about thermopile thermometers or pyrometers?
