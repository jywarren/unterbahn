Hi, all &#8211; [Oliver Yeh](http://space.1337arts.com) and I are down in New Orleans now trying to meet up with local organizers to begin an independent, grassroots ground-truthing/mapping of the spill. 

To be clear &#8211; we&#8217;re not trying to duplicate the satellite imagery or the flyover data (though we&#8217;re helping to coordinate some of the flyovers and trying to make sure the data is publicly accessible). We believe it&#8217;s possible for citizens to use balloons, kites, and other simple and inexpensive tools to produce their own documentation of the spill&#8230; and that such imagery will be essential for environmental and legal reasons in coming years.

To learn more, check out our [organization page](http://wiki.grassrootsmapping.org/show/GrassrootsMappingGulfCoastOilSpill) in the Grassroots Mapping wiki.

_Please, if you&#8217;re involved in the response, and live near the spill, call me at **415 508 6769**, email me at **warren@mit.edu**, and tell us where to come to help you document what&#8217;s going on! _

To join in the discussion or make contact with us, the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/grassrootsmapping/) is a great place to start.
