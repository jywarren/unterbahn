[Sam Kronick](http://newuntitledpage.com/) (read his awesome page, esp. pictures at the bottom) created a micro-nation called the Microdot on the MIT campus, on the large circle of grass known to students there as &#8216;the Dot&#8217;. He briefly seceded from the US (or MIT, I wasn&#8217;t sure), and we managed to make a map of the tiny nation late on its second and last day of existence.

Grassroots balloon mapping is a great way to capture temporary events and document brief invasions of public space&#8230; even protests, as we did in the [West Bank](http://grassrootsmapping.org/2009/12/umm-salamuna-kite-mapping/) last December.
