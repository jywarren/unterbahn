We&#8217;re starting a Kickstarter fundraising campaign to support citizen mappers of the Gulf Oil Spill. Check out the above video, and visit the [Kickstarter page](http://kck.st/cj3Anh). The cool part about Kickstarter is that you get &#8216;rewards&#8217; for pledging given amounts &#8211; if you pledge $10 we&#8217;ll send you a 5&#215;7 print of [one of our images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/sets/72157623910039211/). If you pledge $100, we&#8217;ll do better &#8211; along with a 16&#215;20 poster, we&#8217;ll write your name on one of the kites we use to capture this imagery! But we need your help to get the word out. Unless we reach our funding goal by June 21, nobody pays &#8211; it&#8217;s all or nothing!

Keep track of the campaign with the badge on the right:
