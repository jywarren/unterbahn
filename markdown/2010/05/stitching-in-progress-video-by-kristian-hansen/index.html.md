A couple updates: we&#8217;re now deep in the stitching process. Above is a preview; we hope to post one or two finished stitches today. 

Kris Ansin of Tulane and [Louisiana Bucket Brigade](http://labucketbrigade.org) is coordinating mapping teams on the ground. (He&#8217;s leading a trip today). We&#8217;ve had some donations but if you&#8217;re able to, please [donate to support our efforts](http://grassrootsmapping.org/donate/). Even $50 will buy us a tank of helium. $100 buys us a new kite. 

In the meantime we&#8217;ve had some great support from Kristian Hansen of [TungstenMonkey](http://www.tungstenmonkey.com/), a local production company. Kristian documented our training session last Saturday and has posted an intro video to our project which gets across a lot of information in a very short time. Thanks Kristian!
