> Because of the large number of workers recruited to the area for the Manhattan Project, the Army planned a town for project workers at the eastern end of the valley. The time required for the project's completion caused the Army to opt for a relatively permanent establishment rather than a camp of enormous size.>

> The architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) was contracted to provide a layout for the town and house designs.[13] SOM Partner John O. Merrill moved to Tennessee to take charge of designing the secret buildings at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[14] He directed the creation of a town,[15] which soon had 300 miles of roads, 55 miles of railroad track, ten schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and cafeterias, and 13 supermarkets. A library with 9,400 books, a symphony, sporting facilities, church services for 17 denominations, and a Fuller Brush Company salesman served the new city and its 75,000 residents.[16] Prefabricated modular homes, apartments, and dormitories, many made from cemesto (bonded cement and asbestos) panels, were quickly erected. Streets were laid out in the manner of a "planned community."
