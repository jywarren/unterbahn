> There isn't one map of the world.   
> 
> Anyone who has worked with maps for a while knows this -- that the process of making a map is something that is creative in form, and that all of the pieces that go into it play a major role in what comes out.

> ...each aerial image is a creative work, prepared via a certain process and attempting to achieve certain goals.

> There are too many different views of the world to make them all work equally well. Let's get it so that people can build *their* view of the world arond them first, and then move on, rather than trying to come at it the other way...

> To that end, I am actively putting my money where my mouth is: my hope> 
> is to spend the next couple weeks building a service which allows users> 
> to build a local view of the world around them, combining the imagery> 
> available in OAM in the way that they see fit. (This work has been> 
> started in [https://github.com/crschmidt/mosaic-webui](https://github.com/crschmidt/mosaic-webui) ; it's far from> 
> done, but progress is happening.) I'm also exploring the use of> 
> MapMill and MapKnitter, two great tools for helping build better> 
> maps using highly local imagery.
