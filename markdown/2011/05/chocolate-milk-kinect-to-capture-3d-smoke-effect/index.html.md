Freidrich Kirschner (currently working out of the [p.irateship](http://p.irateship.com)) has done an amazing 3d capture of "smoke" for a scene in his movie where a rocket blasts off -- using chocolate milk, a tub of water, and a Kinect, and his own [Moviesandbox](http://moviesandbox.com/) software! it's pretty amazing. Support his work (open source) [on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/768129503/moviesandbox-an-open-source-3d-animation-tool)!
