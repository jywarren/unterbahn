Thanks to [Stefaan Lippens](http://stefaanlippens.net/extract-images-from-pdf-documents) for this snippet to extract images from a PDF:

> Usage is very straightforward:> 
> 
> pdfimages -j foo.pdf  bar> 
> 
> This will extract all images from foo.pdf and save them in JPEG format (option -j) to bar-000.jpg, bar-001.jpg, bar-002.jpg, etc.
