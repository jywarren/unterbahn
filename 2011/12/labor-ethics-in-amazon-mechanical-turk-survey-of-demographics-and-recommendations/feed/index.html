I just wanted to give you a quick heads up! Other then that, superb blog!&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swtorcredits1000k.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cheapest swtor credits&lt;/a&gt;</description>

		<description>In addition to labor laws, I&#039;m curious as to what would happen with crowd-sourcing if the project output gets truly innovative. Like, the ethics of appropriating someone&#039;s contribution under a work-for-hire arrangement if a number of people undercompensated for truly creative contributions.</description>

		<description>We used AMT sometimes at the psych lab I worked at, to get online participants for our studies.  I think generally we did pay minimum wage, but that&#039;s in large part (maybe entirely?) because we had internal review boards who were used to ensuring fair payment for our in person subjects.</description>
